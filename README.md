# ELEC-271-Digital-Systems
VHDL Code for Labs done in a 2nd year Digital Systems course at Queen's University (Both completed files and some template files). Also included are pdf files describing the labs and accessory files needed for the code to work. Most of the code works on the Quartus software for Cyclone III FPGA Chips.
The topics covered in the lab include the basics of specifying circuits leading up to the hiearchical design of a FSM controller on seven segment displays. 
## Note
The code for lab 1 is missing since I forgot to save the code on a USB drive.
